name: 'Salmon: mapping-based quantification'
description: |-
  Salmon is a tool for wicked-fast transcript quantification from RNA-seq data. It requires a set of target transcripts (either from a reference or de-novo assembly) to quantify. This capsule performs quantification using raw fastq RNA reads and an index generated from an input reference.
